; Input >> Output Examples
;
; adjacentElementsProduct([1, 2, 3]); ==> return 6
; Explanation:
; The maximum product obtained from multiplying 2 * 3 = 6, and they're adjacent numbers in the array.
;
; adjacentElementsProduct([9, 5, 10, 2, 24, -1, -48]); ==> return 50
; Explanation:
; Max product obtained from multiplying 5 * 10 = 50.
;
; adjacentElementsProduct([-23, 4, -5, 99, -27, 329, -2, 7, -921])  ==>  return -14
