;; Easy Wallpaper
;
; John wants to decorate a room with wallpaper. He's heard that making sure he has the right amount of wallpaper is
; more complex than it sounds. He wants a fool-proof method for getting it right.
; John knows that the rectangular room has a length of l meters, a width of w meters, a height of h meters. The
; standard width of the rolls he wants to buy is 52 centimeters. The length of a roll is 10 meters. He bears in mind
; however, that itâ€™s best to have an extra length of wallpaper handy in case of mistakes or miscalculations so he
; wants to buy a length 15% greater than the one he needs.
; Last time he did these calculations he got a headache, so could you help John? Your function wallpaper(l, w, h)
; should return as a plain English word in lower case the number of rolls he must buy.
;
; Example:
;   wallpaper(4.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "ten"
;   wallpaper(0.0, 3.5, 3.0) should return "zero"
; Notes:
;
;    all rolls (even with incomplete width) are put edge to edge
;    0 <= l, w, h (floating numbers), it can happens that w x h x l is zero
;    the integer r (number of rolls) will always be less or equal to 20
