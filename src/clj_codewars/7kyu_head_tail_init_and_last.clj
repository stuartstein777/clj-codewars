;; Head, Tail, Init and Last
; Haskell has some useful functions for dealing with lists:
;     GHCi, version 7.6.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
;     位 head [1,2,3,4,5]
;     1
;     位 tail [1,2,3,4,5]
;     [2,3,4,5]
;     位 init [1,2,3,4,5]
;     [1,2,3,4]
;     位 last [1,2,3,4,5]
;     5
;
; Your job is to implement these functions in your given language. Make sure it doesn't edit the array; that would
; cause problems! Here's a cheat sheet:
;
;     | HEAD | <----------- TAIL ------------> |
;     [  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9,  10]
;     | <----------- INIT ------------> | LAST |
;
;     head [x] = x
;     tail [x] = []
;     init [x] = []
;     last [x] = x
;
; Here's how I expect the functions to be called in your language:
;
; (head [1,2,3,4,5]) => 1
; (tail [1,2,3,4,5]) => [2,3,4,5]

(defn head [xs]
  (first xs))

(defn tail [xs]
  (rest xs))

(defn last_ [xs]
  (last xs))

(defn init [xs]
  (butlast xs))
